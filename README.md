About the Extension

As a 15 year old, I still have a lot ot learn towards my computer science career. With school and homework sometimes, I wish all of it would disappear. Thats why I made my extension, "Homework Immunity". 

This extension focuses on removing all traces of the word "homework" and replacing it with the words "Play video games" in an rgb rainbow cycling text. This may not be practical during school, but many of my freinds and neighbors tell me that their parents issue them to study if they happen to read any text realting ot homework. Instead of being reminded to do work, their parents will catch the attention of video games, which has nothing to do with homework.

I built this website on java which I learned a lot from cs50, but also from web developers on youtube. 

How to use- install the exxtension from your chrome web store.
